          School in Cupertino, Calif., and enrolls at Reed College in Portland,
          Ore., only to drop out a semester later. Jobs would go on to sit in on
          classes that interested him, such as calligraphy, despite not getting
          credit for them.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="timestamp">1974:</span> Begins a brief stint as an

          version of Pong, the game that would go on to become Breakout. Jobs

          $1.5 million Ridley Scott-directed "1984" Super Bowl commercial airs,
          introduces the Macintosh to much fanfare during Apple's shareholder
          meeting. "For the first time ever, I'd like to let Macintosh speak for
          itself." The computer's voice then says, "Never trust a computer you
          can't lift." Macintosh becomes the first commercially successful small
          computer with a graphical user interface.

          saying in a board meeting, "I've been thinking a lot, and it's time
          for me to get on with my life. It's obvious that I've got to do
          something. I'm 30 years old." Soon thereafter, Jobs starts NeXT
          Computer (which later becomes NeXT Software), funded by selling $70
          million of his Apple stock. An "interpersonal" NeXT workstation,
          sporting a built-in Ethernet port, is used by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN

          of Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. The film earns $192 million
          at the box office. Its success helps make it quite attractive for
          celebrities to lend their voices to animated characters.
